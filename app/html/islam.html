      <h2>What is Islam?</h2>
      <p>Islam is a monotheistic faith centered on the belief in one God (Allah), who is merciful, compassionate, and just. Muslims believe that God sent prophets throughout history to guide humanity, with the final prophet being Muhammad (peace be upon him). Islam teaches submission to the will of God, striving for righteousness, and living a life of compassion, justice, and service to others. The Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (Hadith) form the foundation of Islamic belief and practice.</p>
