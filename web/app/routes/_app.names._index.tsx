            The Names of Allah, known as Asma ul Husna (The Most Beautiful
            Names), are the 99 attributes and qualities through which Muslims
            identify and connect with Allah. These names are mentioned
            throughout the Quran and Hadith, and they describe Allah's perfect
            attributes, characteristics, and actions.

              Allah has 99 names mentioned in Islamic tradition, though His
              attributes are limitless.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) said: "Allah has
              ninety-nine names, one hundred minus one; whoever enumerates them
              will enter Paradise."
            </li>
            <li>
              Each name reveals a different aspect of Allah's nature and
              relationship with creation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Muslims often recite these names in devotional practices, seeking
              to understand the divine attributes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The greatest of these names is considered to be "Allah" itself,
              which encompasses all other attributes.

            Understanding and contemplating the Names of Allah is central to
            developing a deeper connection with the Creator. These names help
            Muslims comprehend how Allah interacts with creation through His
            mercy, wisdom, power, and justice.

            The Quran encourages believers to call upon Allah through His
            beautiful names: "And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him
            by them" (Quran 7:180). Muslims often recite specific names in
            different situations â€“ calling on Al-Shafi (The Healer) when sick,
            or Al-Razzaq (The Provider) when in need.
