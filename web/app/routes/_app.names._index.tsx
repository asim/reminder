            The Quran encourages believers to call upon Allah through His beautiful names: "And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him by them" (Quran 7:180). Muslims often recite specific names in different situations â€“ calling on Al-Shafi (The Healer) when sick, or Al-Razzaq (The Provider) when in need.
