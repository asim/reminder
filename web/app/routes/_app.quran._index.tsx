            What is the Quran?
          </h2>
          <p className='text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700'>
            The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed to be the word of
            Allah as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel.
            It serves as a guidance and a message for all of humanity,
            containing verses that are perfectly explained and revealed in
            Arabic. It is considered a complete and clear book, serving as a
            guide, a reminder, and a mercy for those who have faith.

          </h2>
          <p className='text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700'>
            Each chapter (surah) of the Quran has a name, often derived from a
            notable word or theme within it. Surahs are classified as either
            Meccan (revealed in Mecca) or Medinan (revealed after migration to
            Medina), with each having distinct themes and characteristics.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 sm:mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700'>
            The first surah, Al-Fatihah (The Opening), is a short prayer that
            Muslims recite in their daily prayers. The longest surah is the
            second one, Al-Baqarah (The Cow), with 286 verses.

            Significance
          </h2>
          <p className='text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700'>
            For Muslims, the Quran is more than just a religious textâ€”it's a
            comprehensive guide to life. It addresses spiritual, social, legal,
            and personal matters, offering guidance on how to live according to
            divine will.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-1 sm:mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-gray-700'>
            Unlike many religious texts, the Quran is meant to be recited aloud,
            and its melodious nature is considered part of its miracle. The art
            of Quranic recitation (tajweed) is highly developed in Islamic
            tradition.
